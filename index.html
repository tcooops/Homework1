	<section>Hey! I'm Tessa. I'm a former radio host and audio producer. I graduated from the MTP-Radio Broadcasting program at Fanshawe College and Western U in 2015. From there, I had a successful albiet short career in radio. I worked on-air for Corus in London for a year. I then moved to Wingham, Ontario to pursue a career as an commerical and imaging audio producer. From there in 2017, I moved to Windsor, Ontario where I was the Midday and Afternoon host for Blackburn Radio's Mix 96.7. At 26 years old, I decided to make the bold move to quit my career, move home with my mum, and go back to school at Fanshshawe for IDP. We're only a few weeks in, but so far I'm loving it.</section>
